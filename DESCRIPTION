Description: A collection of datasets essential for functional genomic analysis. Gene names, gene positions, cytoband information, sourced from Ensembl and phenotypes association graph prepared from GWAScatalog are included. Data is available in both GRCh37 and 38 builds. These datasets facilitate a wide range of genomic studies, including the identification of genetic variants, exploration of genomic features, and post-GWAS functional analysis.
